# JPEG Forgery Detection and Localization with Mode-based First Digit Features

This package implements a multi-scale JPEG forgery detector based on mode-based first digit features and SVM classification [1]. The detector delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. The figure below shows comparison of the F1 and AUC scores in a large-scale evaluation (4,620 images representing 220 realistic forgery cases with various JPEG compression settings). 

The included detector is denoted as `FDF-<window-size>`, depending on the size of the analysis window. The performance can be further improved by using multi-scale fusion (see `FDF-F/*` in the figure and [1] for details). Implementation of multi-scale fusion methods can be found in a [separate repository](https://github.com/pkorus/multiscale-prnu) (see [2] for more details).

A qualitative comparison with state-of-the-art detectors on realistic forgery examples with various compression settings is shown below. For more information, please see a comprehensive evaluation in [3]

## Usage

Use `setup` to automatically add dependencies to the Matlab's path. Then, run `main` to process sample images (see code for usage example). [LibSVM](https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm) is needed for SVM classification. 

## Machine Learning Models

The detector uses SVM detection models pre-trained on the UCID dataset (1,338 color, uncompressed images, see [1] for training details). The models can be trained for specific JPEG quality levels (*quality-aware* training), or for a generic case (*quality-oblivious* training). The former case leads to better performance, but requires multiple models - for each supported quality level. See [3] for more information about the expected difference in performance between the two cases. 

To limit repository size, this package includes pre-trained models for the *quality-oblivious* case only. Three window sizes are included: 32x32, 64x64 and 128x128 px. A full set of SVM models for 8 analysis windows and quality levels: 50, 51, ..., 100 can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aJjrM0TkgGkvJgN78Xotu9ZueZthjt7L/view?usp=sharing) (1.4 GB).
